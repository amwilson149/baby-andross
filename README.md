# baby-andross

baby-andross is a collection of code that computes properties about changing neuronal connectivity in developing cerebellum 
from reconstructions of two high-resolution, electron microscopy (EM) image volumes of young mouse cerebellar cortex.

## The Datasets
(1) Postnatal day 3 (P3): 180 um x 120 um x 50 um

(2) Postnatal day 7 (P7): 180 um x 120 um x 75 um

Both volumes have a resolution of 4 nm/px x 4 nm/px x 30 nm/image section.
